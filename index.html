<p>
    With regards to our curricular programming, upon evaluating various curriculams from around the world, KIST chose to adopt the world-renowned International Baccalaureateâ€™s Primary Years Programme (K1 to Grade 5), Middle Years Programme (Grades 6 to 10) and Diploma Programme (Grades 11 and 12) as the most appropriate curriculum frameworks for our school. The school provides a safe and a fun area for children. In the school they have a library in each building, a field to play in recess, afterschool activities, and japanese classes.

<h2>By the founder of K.International.School</h2>
<p>
    In the past, international schools in Japan catered mainly to non-Japanese children and returnees, and charged high tuition fees since many were ineligible to secure government funding to operate. Only children from financially privileged families with a high social status were able to receive an international education. With the aim of improving this situation in order to provide children with an opportunity to receive a high quality international education and to nurture competent individuals able to contribute to our future global society, I founded K. International School Tokyo (KIST) with my wife in 1997.
